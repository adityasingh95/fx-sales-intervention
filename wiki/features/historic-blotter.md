# Feature — Historic Deals Blotter

Read-only view of deals in terminal states. Sits below the Active Blotter, ~30% of remaining vertical height. Session-only; no paging in v1.

## Columns

Same as the Active Blotter, except:

- Status column shows the terminal state (e.g. `TradeConfirmed`, `TraderRejected`).
- Rate column shows the final executed rate (or final quoted rate for non-completed deals).
- **Reasons column hidden.**
- **Outcome column added at the end (160px).** One of:
  - `Executed` — SI or RFS reached `TradeConfirmed`.
  - `Rejected by Trader` — SI reached `TraderRejected`.
  - `Rejected by Client` — SI reached `ClientRejected`.
  - `Expired` — RFS reached `Expired`.
  - `Cancelled` — RFS reached `ClientClosed`.

### v3 columns + clickable rows (`?dev=v3`)

Under v3 (gated by `isV3()`, inserted via `...(isV3() ? [col] : [])` spreads so the GA layout is unchanged):

| Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Request ID | `REQ-XXXXXX` | Minted at deal creation (`src/lib/ids.ts`). |
| Trade ID | `TRD-XXXXXX` | Minted at archive closure — present for executed deals. |
| Value Date | `valueDateForTenor` | Tenor-aware settlement date. |

Each Historic **row becomes clickable** under v3 (FXSW-060): clicking sets `uiStore.openHistoricId` and opens the read-only [historical trade detail](historical-detail.md) overlay (deal terms + markup reason + lifecycle timeline). Without the flag, Historic rows are static as before.

### v4 Instrument column + dual value dates (`?dev=v4`)

Under v4 (`isV4()`): an **Instrument** column shows `instrumentOf(deal)` (`SPOT`/`OUTRIGHT`/`NDF`/`SWAP`), and the **Value Date** cell shows both swap leg dates `near → far` (FXSW-086). The [historical detail](historical-detail.md) overlay additionally carries the per-leg swap breakdown. See [ndf.md](ndf.md) / [swaps.md](swaps.md).

## Sorting & capacity

- Default sort: Time descending. Most recent terminal events at the top.
- Cap: 100 rendered rows. Oldest beyond that are dropped.

## Empty state

> "No historic deals yet."

## How deals get here

When the SI machine reaches the `Removed` final state (5 seconds after a terminal SI state) — or when the RFS machine reaches `Removed` for ESP deals (where SI stays at `Initial`) — the [dealsStore](../components/deals-store.md) archives the entry from `deals` to `historic`. The outcome label is derived at archival time from the final RFS and SI states.

The archive call is idempotent — whichever subscriber (RFS or SI) fires `Removed` first wins; the second is a no-op.

## Test contract

The blotter body wrapper carries `data-testid="historic-blotter-body"`. Each row is a `<button>` inside:

```html
<div data-testid="historic-blotter-body">
  <button
    data-deal-id="d_001"
    data-outcome="Executed"
  >
</div>
```

`data-outcome` is the canonical test-assertion attribute, per `docs/07-scenario-pack.md` test fidelity notes.

## Tests

`src/features/blotter/HistoricBlotter.test.tsx` — **2 cases**. Empty-state message; rendered rows show the right outcome label per `outcomeFromFinalStates`.

End-to-end archival from terminal SI/RFS state through to the historic list is covered by `dealsStore.test.ts` — see [components/deals-store.md](../components/deals-store.md) §Tests.

## Implementation

- Component: `src/features/blotter/HistoricBlotter.tsx`.
- Wired to `useHistoricDeals()` from `dealsStore`.
- `outcomeFromFinalStates(siState, rfsState)` maps the final state pair to one of the five outcome labels.

## Confirmation tickets — out of scope

The canonical workflow allows launching a confirmation ticket from a historic row. Not implemented in v1.
