# Feature — Dev Injector

Hidden control panel that lets the demo operator inject pre-canned scenarios on demand. Visible only when the URL includes `?dev=1`. Replaces the right side of the header with a row of buttons.

## Buttons

One button per scenario plus a Reset session button:

| Button | Scenario ID | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Inject: Happy Path ESP | `HAPPY_PATH_ESP` | Auto-priced EURUSD flows through Active → 5s pause → Historic, no SI interaction. |
| Inject: Off-Hours Intervention | `OFF_HOURS_INTERVENTION` | New SI deal with `OFF_HOURS` reason; client accepts ~1.5s after `Send Stream`. |
| Inject: Credit Breach | `CREDIT_BREACH` | New SI deal with `CREDIT_LIMIT` reason; trader rejects. |
| Inject: Size Limit + Margin Tune | `SIZE_LIMIT_MARGIN_TUNE` | New SI deal with `SIZE_LIMIT` reason; expects trader to widen margin first. |
| Inject: Release Path | `RELEASE_PATH` | New SI deal; trader picks up, then releases back to the desk. |
| Reset session | — | Calls `dealFeed.reset()`, stops every live actor, wipes both `deals` and `historic` in the store. |

Each inject button invokes `dealFeed.inject(scenarioId)`. The scenario player then drives the resulting `DealEvent`s into the deal feed — see [components/deal-feed.md](../components/deal-feed.md) and [components/scenario-player.md](../components/scenario-player.md).

Reset has a distinct red border to signal destructiveness.

## Why hidden by default

The injector is a demo/dev tool, not a trader-facing feature. Hiding it behind `?dev=1` means the production-look URL is the trader experience while the injector remains one query-param away for screenshares and async sharing.

## Test contract

```html
<button data-testid="inject-HAPPY_PATH_ESP">…</button>
<button data-testid="inject-OFF_HOURS_INTERVENTION">…</button>
<button data-testid="inject-CREDIT_BREACH">…</button>
<button data-testid="inject-SIZE_LIMIT_MARGIN_TUNE">…</button>
<button data-testid="inject-RELEASE_PATH">…</button>
<button data-testid="reset-session">…</button>
```

Each E2E scenario spec drives the first click via the corresponding `data-testid`. See [scenarios/](../scenarios/).
